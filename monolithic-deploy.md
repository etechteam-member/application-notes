# Monolithic App Deployment Approaches

---

## 1. Classic Virtual Machine (VM) Deployment

- Build the app locally (e.g., `mvn package`, `python setup.py build`, etc.)
- Create an OS package (`.deb`, `.rpm`, or just zip/binary).
- Upload to a VM (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine).
- Install and run manually (use `systemd`, `supervisord`, or shell scripts).

> **Example:**  
> - Build Python app → SCP files to EC2 → SSH → run with Gunicorn → expose via Nginx.

**Pros:**  
- Simple, direct access  
- Easy for small teams  

**Cons:**  
- Hard to scale  
- Manual updates  
- Higher downtime risks

## 2. Bare Metal Servers (On-Prem Monoliths)

- Install and run apps directly on physical servers.
- Behind a hardware or software load balancer (like F5 BIG-IP, HAProxy).
- Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef).
- Deploy using custom scripts or cron jobs.

> **Example:**  
> - Build artifact → deploy via Ansible → systemd service → monitored manually.

**Pros:**  
- Maximum control  
- No recurring cloud costs  

**Cons:**  
- High upfront and maintenance costs  
- Slower disaster recovery

## 3. Dockerized Monolith (Single Container Deployment)

- Package the entire app and dependencies inside a single Docker container.
- Deploy container on:
  - Docker Swarm
  - AWS ECS (EC2 launch type)
  - Self-hosted Docker servers

> **Example:**  
> - Flask app → Dockerfile → build image → deploy container.

**Pros:**  
- Easy portability  
- Consistent environments  
- Easier rollbacks

**Cons:**  
- Container size can get large  
- Single point of failure if not replicated

---

## 4. Elastic Beanstalk (AWS Managed Monolith Hosting)

- Package app (ZIP, WAR, or Docker image).
- Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk.
- AWS handles:
  - EC2 management
  - Load balancers
  - Auto-scaling
  - Monitoring

> **Example:**  
> - Django app → ZIP → upload to Elastic Beanstalk Python environment.

**Pros:**  
- Easy scaling and management  
- Built-in monitoring/logs  
- Rapid deployment

**Cons:**  
- Less infrastructure control  
- Can be expensive at scale

---

## 5. PaaS Deployments (Platform-as-a-Service)

- Platforms: Heroku, Render, Railway, Fly.io, Azure App Service, etc.
- Git-based deployment.
- PaaS handles build, scale, and run.

> **Example:**  
> - Node.js app → `git push heroku main` → deployed automatically.

**Pros:**  
- No DevOps burden  
- Focus purely on code  
- Auto-scaling supported

**Cons:**  
-  Vendor lock-in risks  
-  Less customization for network and storage

# Quick Visual Map

```plaintext
Local Machine → Package → VM Upload (Classic VM)
Local Machine → Package → Docker Build → Deploy Container (Dockerized Monolith)
Git Push → Elastic Beanstalk (AWS PaaS Monolith Hosting)
Git Push → Heroku/Render (Third-Party PaaS)
